## History
I first created this application in early-to-mid 2020, mostly to be used by myself and friends.
At the time I didn't know how to use GitHub. Now that I do, I thought I might as well upload this project in case anyone else wants to use it.

## What it does
ImageStack is for lazy people like me who want to stack images one atop the other to make memes without using a proper image editor.
It's a simple, purpose-built tool.

## How to use it
1) Drag and drop images into the main screen
2) Choose your stack direction
3) Reorder with Move Left and Move Right if necessary
4) Press Create and preview the result in the image viewer
5) Export as PNG or JPEG

Note that you won't be able to delete the original file until you remove them from the list in ImageStack or close ImageStack.

## Other notes
The image viewer in this project is a custom WinForms control I have used in several of my projects.
If you'd like to use it, I could spin it off into it's own project.
